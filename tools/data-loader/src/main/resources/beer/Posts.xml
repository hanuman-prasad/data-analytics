I mean users and community)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;To me, the competitive differentiator that makes this site unique is the software and the format for answering questions and voting.

Its clear to me you can't continue to use this software at the rates they are charging.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;People are not going to pay for information they can get for free from other sites, even if those sites are in a &quot;message board&quot; format.

You can even do it with a &quot;question of the day&quot; that gets moved into the wiki itself after being answered.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That format will give you the competitive advantage of accessibility.

Can we reach a point funded solely by ads before the founders run out of spare cash? I use ad-block+, a firefox add-on, so I usually don't see the advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Affiliate&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has the potential to get more revenue than passive ads. It will be more work since we have to find a way to drive users through to the affiliate site. One way to do this would be to post-process questions &amp;amp; answers for keywords (like &lt;em&gt;keg&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;chiller&lt;/em&gt;) and forcibly link them to the affiliate site. I'm loathe to suggest it, but it could be quite powerful.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Donations&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This has worked for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hbd.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Homebrew Digest&lt;/a&gt; since about the dawn of time (Oct '88). Their expenses are likely much lower than ours - it is an email list and some 1980's-looking web sites.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;DIY&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cheapest, cash-wise. Most expensive, time-wise. I know the founders are a couple of capable young guys. StackExchange is a great platform and we, as users, would have to put up with a less featureful site while PJ &amp;amp; Taylor build something from the ground up. It did not take much time for BrewAdvice to hit a sufficient number of users that they were happy to turn over &quot;control&quot; to us, so once the two of them (with help from others here) get a working site BA will quickly be back to full-strength.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Sponsorship&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;$1600 a year is a small amount for any large homebrew shop or brewery. There is already good content here, making the pitch to potential donors easier.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://morebeer.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;B&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://northernbrewer.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Northern Brewer&lt;/a&gt; have sponsored the Brewing Network and would be my first place to look.  Many microbreweries consider themselves &quot;teaching&quot; breweries and would be open to fostering beer knowledge growth. Get a good pitch, show them what we are doing for the community and the money will come.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Partner&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's been said before: BredAdvice lacks some features to make it a one-stop-shop for brewing information. By partnering or integrating with other sites, like the recipe-sharing site &lt;a href=&quot;http://hopville.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;HopVille&lt;/a&gt; (and makers of &lt;a href=&quot;http://beercalculus.hopville.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;BeerCalculus&lt;/a&gt;) or a &quot;real&quot; wiki like &lt;a href=&quot;http://brewwiki.com/index.php/Main%5FPage&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;BrewWiki&lt;/a&gt;, those shortfalls can be overcome. With more to offer, users will come back (and click on your ads).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerDisplayName="Dean Brundage" LastActivityDate="2010-12-02T19:26:34.510" CommentCount="3" />

It's only semi-private ;-)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In theory you could also invite the user to a new dedicated chat-room you can create, but all conversation will be public and stay around forever, so this is hardly what you want.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, you could go to the moderator chat channel and ask more experienced moderators how they handle this.

If your answer &lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt; ends up being useful to other folks with the same question, this site has served its purpose: removing the need for folks to sift through blogs and forums to dig up the answers they need.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;2) But Stack Exchange &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have a few other tricks up its sleeve&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even though the main site &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; is a fairly specialized tool, the need for discussion and sharing is hardly uncommon - in fact, they're so often needed that we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; provide access to some common tools for tackling these jobs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's a &quot;chat&quot; system available for every site. I put &quot;chat&quot; in quotes for a reason; you can use it to chew the fat with your peers in real-time, just like many other chat systems out there... But the messages are all archived, and you can respond to folks who aren't actually sitting there with the chat room open - they'll be notified on the main site, or next time they drop by. So if you wanted to create a room of your own and make a daily post or two about what you've been up to, that'll be there whenever for anyone who cares to read it. And if you want to create a room and invite a few friends in to swap or discuss recipes, that'll work too. This is one of the more recent additions to Stack Exchange, and a lot of folks haven't really done much with it... But if you're interested, &lt;a href=&quot;http://chat.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;stop by and check it out.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is even &lt;em&gt;newer&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/blog-overflow/&quot;&gt;we &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; offer blog hosting.&lt;/a&gt; Not in the sense of &quot;this is my personal journal where I share brewing tips and cat pictures&quot; though: the idea here is to create a public face for your site, give it some personality, invite folks writing good answers or doing interesting stuff to talk about it at length beyond the constraints of the strict Q&amp;amp;A format on the main site. In a sense, this is the polar opposite of Chat, which sites &lt;em&gt;behind the scenes&lt;/em&gt; and is often informal or even chaotic. &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/11/the-best-of-blog-overflow-october-2011/&quot;&gt;Blogging can be a challenge&lt;/a&gt;, and not every person or every site is up for that - but if you're interested, or think other folks on the site might be, go ahead and give it a try... &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1163" LastActivityDate="2011-11-04T05:01:25.703" CommentCount="4" />

Certainly, knowing the background of an author will help answerers determine the best course of action. The divide in experience is not important to &lt;em&gt;classifying the question&lt;/em&gt;, however, and that is the purpose of tags. Whether someone is fresh to the subject, or has been brewing for years, that is easily something covered by the body of the question as part of the background detail.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do we have any strong arguments for retaining this tag, or can we get rid of it? I think that having this kind of tag is problematic, both because of its non-categorical nature, and because it fosters a divide on the level of &lt;em&gt;questions&lt;/em&gt; when it comes to experience level.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="1604" LastActivityDate="2019-06-26T12:29:17.153" Title="What purpose does a [newbie] tag serve?"

E.g. discussion of beer storage temperature and how long a beer lasts once bottled, would be relevant to both sites, although on the homebrewing site, the discussion would also include typical homebrewing equipment, such as corny kegs, which aren't used much outside of homebrewing and rarely encountered by the typical beer consumer.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;One question on the proposed site, &quot;How much of an impact does the water (minerals/quality/distilled) have on a beer?&quot; struck me as possibly off-topic for that site, since it's mainly a production issue - a consumer cannot change the water used to brew the beer, and the impact of water and water chemistry in brewing is heavily discussed here since it is primarily relevant to brewers and not consumers. (Although an understanding of why breweries produce the beer they do because of the nature of the local water may be considered beer appreciation and worthy of mention on the proposed site, but any advanced treatment of the subject should be served by this site.)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beer styles are occasionally discussed here, but typically from the perspective of brewing that style (e.g. process+recipe). Visitors are assumed to be aware of the BJCP or similar style guidelines as well as the basic differences between an ale and a lager. Yet, beer styles is very pertinent to beer appreciation and would be a good topic on the proposed site. Discussions of different breweries, beer history, nomenclature are also off topic here, but these also would be great questions on the proposed site. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given that focus of the two sites is mostly distinct, I would keep the two sites separate.

I think that many beer enthusiasts' eyes will glaze over after reading a few pages about proper sanitation, varieties of yeast, and hopping techniques.  When I come to Homebrew, that's exactly what I'm looking for, and I don't want to wade past questions asking what a Kolshbier is.  I believe that it would dilute the value for both audiences.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; some overlap, but I daresay that the reasons are different.  If a consumer wants to know what hops are in Beer X, I would wager its so that they can find (consume) more beers with that flavor profile.  If a producer want to know what hops are in Beer X, I would again wager that it's so that he or she re-create that flavor profile.  The initial discussion is the same, but the ultimate direction is different.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I looked at the proposal (now past definition and into commitment), and I looked at another site in definition: &lt;a href=&quot;http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/49291/alcoholic-beverages&quot;&gt;Alcoholic Beverages&lt;/a&gt;.  The Alcoholic Beverages SE addresses everything that Beer would, plus the same for any other type of alcohol (wine, spirits, cocktails, etc.)  Ultimately, I'm backing Alcoholic Beverages, and the reasons come down to objectivity and quantity.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I would posit that a significant portion of &lt;strong&gt;consumption&lt;/strong&gt; is subjective, which not the purpose of SE.  The community seeks to answer objective, unique questions.  I think that when it comes to consumption, there will be far fewer objective questions, i.e. more &quot;&lt;em&gt;Which beer goes best with grilled octopus&lt;/em&gt;&quot; than &quot;&lt;em&gt;How long can I reasonably store a bottle of Fifty-Fifty Eclipse&lt;/em&gt;&quot;.  Obviously, subjective questions would get moderated out, but the upshot is that there's less quality content, and less quality content means less usage.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So if there's less content, then one way to bring up quantity is to broaden the subject matter.  If you allow not just &quot;&lt;em&gt;Does a waxed beer bottle retain freshness better than a capped bottle&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, but also &quot;&lt;em&gt;Does a screwcap wine bottle indicate a lesser aging capacity than a corked one&lt;/em&gt;&quot;, then your content capacity expands greatly.  In addition, most alcohol enthusiasts that I know are not single-minded; they will happily partake in a variety of beverages.  Maybe not all, but almost certainly not just one type.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So I do back the idea of a consumer-driven SE, just one with a somewhat different scope.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Welp, this answer ended up being longer than I thought it would... :)&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="3466" LastActivityDate="2013-10-18T19:30:28.937" CommentCount="3" />

RateBeer and BeerAdvocate may be &quot;trash&quot;, but they are wildly popular, as is the Untappd app. Reddit has subreddits devoted to beer appreciation and beer trading, as well as a reputation and voting mechanism. I am concerned that AlcoholicBeverages.SE (or whatever it is called) is just going to be a &quot;me too&quot; site with little traffic. In addition, moderating a forum where the answers range from fairly subjective to totally subjective is going to be a nightmare. Merely defining what is on-topic and off-topic seems fraught with difficulty.

There are not a lot of new questions to ask compared to earlier in the forum's life (when I was not around). Active users are fairly aggressive about pointing out questions that have been asked before. Maybe we need to have a culture that says that re-asking a question that is more than a year old, especiialy when the accepted answer has a score of less than X, is acceptable. For example, I would like to ask a question about how long I can keep milled grain, but the question was asked, and it got only one answer that is fairly good but not great by someone without really high reputation.

For example, &quot;What is malt?&quot;. This is homebrewing related, but the answer is in any dictionary, basic text, encyclopedia, wikipedia, etc. If you don't know what malt is, you probably should look it up elsewhere, because you will have a hard time understanding just about anything on the site without this knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of question that is too simple on the site, and I'd argue that it brings down the quality of the site:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/11365/what-are-finings-how-do-finings-work&quot;&gt;What are finings? How do finings work?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;No one answered this question, so the asker copied and pasted an answer to his own question from wikipedia (with quotes and attribution). I would say there was some value to having it on the site if it were something where an expert could make a valuable contribution to the subject, but in a question like this, how is that possible?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's like asking &quot;What is addition?

If folks ask questions that have answers here, point that out to 'em; if they ask questions that &lt;em&gt;don't&lt;/em&gt; have answers here, feel free to bring up the topic yourself - and if it gets a good answer, then point that out too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don't hesitate to post questions you're researching yourself.&lt;/strong&gt; One of the downsides of homebrew compared to (say) programming is that it requires a fair bit of patience.

On one hand, it doesn't really have anything to do with fermentation or homebrewing.

The title &quot;Beer, Wine, &amp;amp; Spirits&quot; does not exclude homebrewing and would make some questions that have come close to being off-topic (e.g. &lt;a href=&quot;https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/q/3059/12609&quot;&gt;Fruit Liqueur- Chop Fruit?&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/q/16488/12609&quot;&gt;Calculating alcohol percentage after diluting with a sugar syrup&lt;/a&gt;) feel much more at home.  I also think there is overlap in terms of evaluating alcoholic drinks, kegging equipment/processes, and product storage.  Each of these apply both to homebrewed and commercial products, even if there are also setting-specific aspects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On top of all that, both sites are ostensibly stuck in beta due to their low questions-per-day metric.

The effectiveness of these sites runs on voting as well as great questions and answers, if you don't have a question to ask or see one you can answer then voting is another way you can help.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From the Help Center:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help Center &gt; Privileges &gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/vote-up&quot;&gt;vote up&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is voting up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Voting up is how the community indicates which questions and answers are most useful and appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When should I vote up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Whenever you encounter a question, answer or comment that you feel is especially useful, vote it up!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You have a limited number of votes per day, so use them wisely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Follow that link for more information and to find out: &quot;What happens when I vote up?&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help Center &gt; Privileges &gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/help/privileges/vote-down&quot;&gt;vote down&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is voting down?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Voting down, also known as &quot;casting downvotes&quot;, is how the community indicates which questions and answers are least useful.&#xA;  When should I vote down?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Use your downvotes whenever you encounter an egregiously sloppy, no-effort-expended post, or an answer that is clearly and perhaps dangerously incorrect.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;You have a limited number of votes per day, and answer down-votes cost you a tiny bit of reputation on top of that; use them wisely.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Follow that link for more information and to find out: &quot;What happens when I vote down?&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Help Center &gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/help/someone-answers&quot;&gt;Asking&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should I do when someone answers my question?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Decide if the answer is helpful, and then...&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;ol&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vote on it&lt;/strong&gt; (if you have earned the appropriate voting privilege).

If someone has a question more generally about distillation, particularly in a commercial setting, I think leaving that to &lt;a href=&quot;https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/&quot;&gt;https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/&lt;/a&gt; seems reasonable.  But if someone has a question about distilling their fermented products themselves (i.e. at home) I think it could be reasonable to ask here, as long as they aren't specifically asking about how to break laws.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;See my argument &lt;a href=&quot;https://homebrew.meta.stackexchange.com/a/454/12609&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for why I personally think merging the two SE sites could also make sense.  But I think the same argument applies to Homebrewing just being a little more permissive instead of eschewing questions that, while about the creation (and/or modification) of alcoholic drinks at home, but aren't &lt;em&gt;technically&lt;/em&gt; about homebrewing.  It seems like they're similar goals and would presumably appeal to many of the same users.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="12609" LastActivityDate="2019-08-15T19:23:31.773" CommentCount="0" />
