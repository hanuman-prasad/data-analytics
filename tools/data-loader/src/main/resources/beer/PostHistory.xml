Please understand that I say this with the intent to help.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;If this software is going to run you better than a c-note a month and only going to get more expensive as the site grows, then you need to ditch it.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I know, I know, I like the functionality too.  But that being said while there is great advice up here its duplicated and more on at least three other free message style boards that I can think of just offhand.  From a competitive standpoint, you do not have an advantage in knowledge.  (When I say &quot;compete&quot; I don't mean money.  I mean users and community)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To me, the competitive differentiator that makes this site unique is the software and the format for answering questions and voting. But, the people who make this software are going to make it too expensive to continue to run it.  I hate to say it, but that leaves you without a lot of choices.  Its clear to me you can't continue to use this software at the rates they are charging.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;People are not going to pay for information they can get for free from other sites, even if those sites are in a &quot;message board&quot; format.  That fact will mean your only revenue will be donations from a few hard core users and the site is too young, too new to have enough of those to keep you afloat all year.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So, with all of this negativity, let me make a suggestion:  Create the ultimate brewing wiki, using free wiki software and the knowledge of the fine people who frequent this site.  You can even do it with a &quot;question of the day&quot; that gets moved into the wiki itself after being answered.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That format will give you the competitive advantage of accessibility. Other sites have brewing wiki's, but you could make yours the best.  It would take time, participation and hard work.  But you have the knowledge basis before you in the answers on the site right now.  That will let you compete and have a chance of success.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

With around 1000 unique visitors/week I was getting around $50/month in Google Adwords revenue from it, at the best times.  But still, with a little work and some networking, affiliate programs can bring you some cash.  If you could become an affiliate of a big online homebrew supply shop like William's Brewing or Home Brew Mart and get kickbacks on referrals, that would likely pay your bills and let you keep this great software.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The site's UI is what sold me right away.

Homebrewers are a great bunch of people; willing and wanting to share their opinions, ideas and designs. However, because the software does not have other features, such as recipe sharing or friending, it will likely always be a small player.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Obviously, I like the site. I have put a lot of my time into it. In order of *least liked to most liked*, here are my opinions. My suggestion is to find a **combination** of revenue streams.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Advertising ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Sufficient advertising revenue is directly dependent on the number of users &amp; quality of ads. Can we reach a point funded solely by ads before the founders run out of spare cash? I use ad-block+, a firefox add-on, so I usually don't see the advertising.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Affiliate ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This has the potential to get more revenue than passive ads. It will be more work since we have to find a way to drive users through to the affiliate site. One way to do this would be to post-process questions &amp; answers for keywords (like *keg* and *chiller*) and forcibly link them to the affiliate site. I'm loathe to suggest it, but it could be quite powerful.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Donations ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This has worked for the [Homebrew Digest][1] since about the dawn of time (Oct '88). Their expenses are likely much lower than ours - it is an email list and some 1980's-looking web sites.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## DIY ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Cheapest, cash-wise. Most expensive, time-wise. I know the founders are a couple of capable young guys. StackExchange is a great platform and we, as users, would have to put up with a less featureful site while PJ &amp; Taylor build something from the ground up. It did not take much time for BrewAdvice to hit a sufficient number of users that they were happy to turn over &quot;control&quot; to us, so once the two of them (with help from others here) get a working site BA will quickly be back to full-strength.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Sponsorship ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;$1600 a year is a small amount for any large homebrew shop or brewery. There is already good content here, making the pitch to potential donors easier.  [B&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;][2] and [Northern Brewer][3] have sponsored the Brewing Network and would be my first place to look.  Many microbreweries consider themselves &quot;teaching&quot; breweries and would be open to fostering beer knowledge growth. Get a good pitch, show them what we are doing for the community and the money will come.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;## Partner ##&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's been said before: BredAdvice lacks some features to make it a one-stop-shop for brewing information. By partnering or integrating with other sites, like the recipe-sharing site [HopVille][4] (and makers of [BeerCalculus][5]) or a &quot;real&quot; wiki like [BrewWiki][6], those shortfalls can be overcome. With more to offer, users will come back (and click on your ads).&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://hbd.org/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: http://morebeer.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [3]: http://northernbrewer.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [4]: http://hopville.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [5]: http://beercalculus.hopville.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [6]: http://brewwiki.com/index.php/Main_Page" />

Anything that gets in the way of this - extended discussion, site management, social connections... is intentionally de-emphasized. That's why we're discussing this *here*, on the meta site, instead of in a post mixed in with questions on yeast, sanitation, and brewing equipment!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There's nothing inherently *wrong* with using multiple tools for multiple tasks. If you want to keep a public log, or share recipes, go ahead and do it - use whatever tools work best for you. If you keep a personal blog *somewhere* detailing your brewing (mis)adventures, you'll have an easy time finding the details when someone eventually asks a question *here* that relates to something you've done, or a recipe you've tried. If your answer *here* ends up being useful to other folks with the same question, this site has served its purpose: removing the need for folks to sift through blogs and forums to dig up the answers they need.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###2) But Stack Exchange *does* have a few other tricks up its sleeve&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Even though the main site *itself* is a fairly specialized tool, the need for discussion and sharing is hardly uncommon - in fact, they're so often needed that we *do* provide access to some common tools for tackling these jobs:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- There's a &quot;chat&quot; system available for every site. I put &quot;chat&quot; in quotes for a reason; you can use it to chew the fat with your peers in real-time, just like many other chat systems out there... But the messages are all archived, and you can respond to folks who aren't actually sitting there with the chat room open - they'll be notified on the main site, or next time they drop by. So if you wanted to create a room of your own and make a daily post or two about what you've been up to, that'll be there whenever for anyone who cares to read it. And if you want to create a room and invite a few friends in to swap or discuss recipes, that'll work too. This is one of the more recent additions to Stack Exchange, and a lot of folks haven't really done much with it... But if you're interested, [stop by and check it out.](http://chat.stackexchange.com/)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- This is even *newer*, but [we *do* offer blog hosting.](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/blog-overflow/) Not in the sense of &quot;this is my personal journal where I share brewing tips and cat pictures&quot; though: the idea here is to create a public face for your site, give it some personality, invite folks writing good answers or doing interesting stuff to talk about it at length beyond the constraints of the strict Q&amp;A format on the main site. In a sense, this is the polar opposite of Chat, which sites *behind the scenes* and is often informal or even chaotic. [Blogging can be a challenge](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/11/the-best-of-blog-overflow-october-2011/), and not every person or every site is up for that - but if you're interested, or think other folks on the site might be, go ahead and give it a try...

Last year, [Jeff wrote this nice blog post about Meta Tags](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/08/the-death-of-meta-tags/), which are tags that describe the nature and identity of the question, rather than the actual content of the problem.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The ultimate goal of a Q&amp;A site is not just to solve the original author's problem, but to solve the problem for all people who have the same issue. Certainly, knowing the background of an author will help answerers determine the best course of action. The divide in experience is not important to *classifying the question*, however, and that is the purpose of tags. Whether someone is fresh to the subject, or has been brewing for years, that is easily something covered by the body of the question as part of the background detail.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Do we have any strong arguments for retaining this tag, or can we get rid of it? I think that having this kind of tag is problematic, both because of its non-categorical nature, and because it fosters a divide on the level of *questions* when it comes to experience level.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;" />

Most of them are too niche to attract that kind of traffic and attention in a reasonable beta period.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;However, if you look at recent sites that have graduated (I'll be looking at RPG, Travel, Judaism and Mathematica) you can see that the bar isn't nearly that high.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [RPG][1] - this is the site I'm looking at that I was most involved in when it graduated. When it graduated it had just 3.4 q/day. The big deal was the excellent quality (and quantity) of answers that were provided and the fact that the traffic was consistently rising (a healthy 1667/day when we graduated). This is a pretty excellent comp for your site as it's a niche (but growing) hobby and survived a very extended beta.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Judaism][2] - This site graduated about the same time RPG did and had a much better number of questions (6.6/day) but more depressed traffic (758/day). Not a great comp as it doesn't occupy the same sector, but also had an extended beta. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; - [Mathematica][3] - This site sailed through it's beta and is one of the fastest launches of late. But you can see why from the stats 12 q/day and 1307 visits/day. This is a poor comparison to your site as it doesn't occupy a niche and is a professional tool rather than a hobby site.

Yes, you can heat the beer to drive off some alcohol, but the results will be poor both in terms of alcohol content and flavor.  It could be pointed out that it's very difficult to make decent malt yourself, and it's best done as a curiosity, not a brewing staple.  He seemed to overlook the need for hops.

I think that many beer enthusiasts' eyes will glaze over after reading a few pages about proper sanitation, varieties of yeast, and hopping techniques.  When I come to Homebrew, that's exactly what I'm looking for, and I don't want to wade past questions asking what a Kolshbier is.  I believe that it would dilute the value for both audiences.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There *is* some overlap, but I daresay that the reasons are different.  If a consumer wants to know what hops are in Beer X, I would wager its so that they can find (consume) more beers with that flavor profile.  If a producer want to know what hops are in Beer X, I would again wager that it's so that he or she re-create that flavor profile.  The initial discussion is the same, but the ultimate direction is different.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I looked at the proposal (now past definition and into commitment), and I looked at another site in definition: [Alcoholic Beverages][1].  The Alcoholic Beverages SE addresses everything that Beer would, plus the same for any other type of alcohol (wine, spirits, cocktails, etc.)  Ultimately, I'm backing Alcoholic Beverages, and the reasons come down to objectivity and quantity.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I would posit that a significant portion of **consumption** is subjective, which not the purpose of SE.  The community seeks to answer objective, unique questions.  I think that when it comes to consumption, there will be far fewer objective questions, i.e. more &quot;*Which beer goes best with grilled octopus*&quot; than &quot;*How long can I reasonably store a bottle of Fifty-Fifty Eclipse*&quot;.  Obviously, subjective questions would get moderated out, but the upshot is that there's less quality content, and less quality content means less usage.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So if there's less content, then one way to bring up quantity is to broaden the subject matter.  If you allow not just &quot;*Does a waxed beer bottle retain freshness better than a capped bottle*&quot;, but also &quot;*Does a screwcap wine bottle indicate a lesser aging capacity than a corked one*&quot;, then your content capacity expands greatly.  In addition, most alcohol enthusiasts that I know are not single-minded; they will happily partake in a variety of beverages.  Maybe not all, but almost certainly not just one type.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;So I do back the idea of a consumer-driven SE, just one with a somewhat different scope.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Welp, this answer ended up being longer than I thought it would... :)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/49291/alcoholic-beverages" />

I will bet you dollars to dnoughnuts that whoever ends up moderating the site is going to end up turning off a large percentage of users who disagree with the moderator's opinions and decisions.  &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Homebrewing.SE has the advantage that, although home brewing allows for a lot of personal style, brewing is a fairly technical endeavor with a lot of scientific and physical underpinning, most of which can be tested somewhat empirically if you choose to do so. In fact, at the craft brewer scale and beyond, beer production is mostly an industrial, distribution, and marketing endeavor, rather than an artisanal undertaking like it is when you are closer to the home brew or brew pub scale." />

Maybe we need to pin the FAQs, newbie Wikis, and most helpful answers to the right of the landing page like www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing does.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(2) There are too many questions asked by users with low reputation that never get an accepted answer or closed. Perhaps new users do not know they are supposed to accept an answer, or they post a question and never return. Is there a way to clean those up?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(3) It seems like so many of the questions that even intermediate brewers have are answered. There are not a lot of new questions to ask compared to earlier in the forum's life (when I was not around). Active users are fairly aggressive about pointing out questions that have been asked before. Maybe we need to have a culture that says that re-asking a question that is more than a year old, especiialy when the accepted answer has a score of less than X, is acceptable. For example, I would like to ask a question about how long I can keep milled grain, but the question was asked, and it got only one answer that is fairly good but not great by someone without really high reputation. I am a little afraid to ask it again, in hopes of getting a more detailed answer.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;(4) The biggest problem seems to be a very low level of activity. I don't have any clever solutions." />

Make [tag:alcohol] more limited to questions regarding the flavor and other effects of (higher) alcohol concentrations while making [tag:abv] a synonym of [tag:alcohol-content] which should be generally about determining the amount of alcohol in a wine, beer, cider, etc.&#xD;&#xA; 2.

Right here. Nothing wrong with that, as long as there are folks around to maintain the information in the archive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said... If folks are to hang around, they kinda need something to keep 'em interested. I'd recommend the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Don't make this your only homebrew site.** Hang around other forums; keep an ear out for what's happening in the field. If folks ask questions that have answers here, point that out to 'em; if they ask questions that *don't* have answers here, feel free to bring up the topic yourself - and if it gets a good answer, then point that out too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Don't hesitate to post questions you're researching yourself.** One of the downsides of homebrew compared to (say) programming is that it requires a fair bit of patience. Testing a new technique or ingredient might require weeks or months before you have any results; if you post about what you're doing, others may be able to save you some time by sharing their own experience... And if not, you can report back and self-answer once your research is completed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Do be patient** just as a lager might take a bit longer than an ale, some sites take longer to gain any real traction. If the topic interests you, hang around and do what you can to make the site work for you; don't stress over numbers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###See also:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- http://meta.homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/14/how-do-we-promote-our-site&#xD;&#xA;- http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257614/graduation-site-closure-and-a-clearer-outlook-on-the-health-of-se-sites" />

If folks ask questions that have answers here, point that out to 'em; if they ask questions that *don't* have answers here, feel free to bring up the topic yourself - and if it gets a good answer, then point that out too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Don't hesitate to post questions you're researching yourself.** One of the downsides of homebrew compared to (say) programming is that it requires a fair bit of patience. Testing a new technique or ingredient might require weeks or months before you have any results; if you post about what you're doing, others may be able to save you some time by sharing their own experience... And if not, you can report back and self-answer once your research is completed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Do be patient** just as a lager might take a bit longer than an ale, some sites take longer to gain any real traction.

Right here. Nothing wrong with that, as long as there are folks around to maintain the information in the archive.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;That said... If folks are to hang around, they kinda need something to keep 'em interested. I'd recommend the following:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Don't make this your only homebrew site.** Hang around other forums; keep an ear out for what's happening in the field. If folks ask questions that have answers here, point that out to 'em; if they ask questions that *don't* have answers here, feel free to bring up the topic yourself - and if it gets a good answer, then point that out too.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Don't hesitate to post questions you're researching yourself.** One of the downsides of homebrew compared to (say) programming is that it requires a fair bit of patience. Testing a new technique or ingredient might require weeks or months before you have any results; if you post about what you're doing, others may be able to save you some time by sharing their own experience... And if not, you can report back and self-answer once your research is completed.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- **Do be patient** just as a lager might take a bit longer than an ale, some sites take longer to gain any real traction. If the topic interests you, hang around and do what you can to make the site work for you; don't stress over numbers.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;###See also:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;- https://homebrew.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/14/how-do-we-promote-our-site&#xD;&#xA;- https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257614/graduation-site-closure-and-a-clearer-outlook-on-the-health-of-se-sites" />

It's only semi-private ;-)&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In theory you could also invite the user to a new dedicated chat-room you can create, but all conversation will be public and stay around forever, so this is hardly what you want.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Finally, you could go to the moderator chat channel and ask more experienced moderators how they handle this. You find a link to it on the [moderator dashboard page][1] in the right sidebar. Asking your question on https://meta.stackoverflow.com/ might also be useful. It's not a homebrew.sx specific one after all.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA; [1]: https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/admin/dashboard&#xD;&#xA; [0]: https://tex.stackexchange.com/" />

This is discussed here: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/02/are-some-questions-too-simple/ &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's implemented on a few other stackexchange sites with this explanation:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;&gt; General reference: this question is too basic; the answer is indexed&#xD;&#xA;&gt; in any number of general internet reference sources designed specifically to find that type of information.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I saw it recently on [english.stackexchange.com][1]&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;There are questions that are too simple. For example, &quot;What is malt?&quot;. This is homebrewing related, but the answer is in any dictionary, basic text, encyclopedia, wikipedia, etc. If you don't know what malt is, you probably should look it up elsewhere, because you will have a hard time understanding just about anything on the site without this knowledge.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Here's an example of question that is too simple on the site, and I'd argue that it brings down the quality of the site:&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/11365/what-are-finings-how-do-finings-work&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;No one answered this question, so the asker copied and pasted an answer to his own question from wikipedia (with quotes and attribution). I would say there was some value to having it on the site if it were something where an expert could make a valuable contribution to the subject, but in a question like this, how is that possible?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;It's like asking &quot;What is addition? How does it work?&quot; on math.stackexchange.com.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Therefore, I think a close option should be added for reason of being too basic. &#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The only worry is that it is tricky one to apply, because there is a fine line between something like &quot;What is mashing?&quot; which I think would be too basic and something like &quot;[What is conversion?][2]&quot; which I also think is too basic, but has triggered some interest.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;An alternative might be to flag posts like this as community wiki.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;  [1]: https://english.stackexchange.com/&#xD;&#xA;  [2]: https://homebrew.stackexchange.com/questions/1521/what-is-conversion" />

Each of these apply both to homebrewed and commercial products, even if there are also setting-specific aspects.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;On top of all that, both sites are ostensibly stuck in beta due to their low questions-per-day metric.  Joining the sites should help with that at least a little, especially if helps encourage questions like the one above that might feel to some users like they don't really fit into either site as they stand now.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I'm curious to see if people's perspectives have changed over time, as some of the arguments I see here appear to be less relevant given the current definition of alcohol.SE." />

I use StackOverflow for both my home and professional coding projects, and I would love to use (brewing)homebrew.se in a similar way but I hold back on professional brewing questions, as they seem very much off topic for a homebrew channel. For these, I use professional brewing forums on facebook, private forums and reaching out to friends in the industry privately.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Regarding beer.se vs alcohol.se vs brewing.se I could see these working well together, as a moderator I see lots of questions on this site that are about enjoyment of the homebrewed product, that people label as off-topic, but I see as a continuation of homebrewing - from grain/grape to glass.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;We see questions about homebrewing, distillation, setting up a brewery, to leagl queries on selling alcohol in the US/Aus/UK to finding hop varieties native to Northern India, the remit of homebrew.se is percievied as far wider that it was initially envisaged.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think merging beer and home brewing could work, but what about homebrewed wine?&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;I think merging homebrew and beer into alcohol would make more sense, and given their new definition of basically all things alcohol may make my next paragraph redundant.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;To my mind what would make the most sense is dropping the 'home' section and turning it into brewing.stackexchange and attract everyone from timid first time home brewer asking &quot;if this looks right&quot; to 40 years experience head brewers asking for a recommendation on brewhouse designs and/or malt suppliers in the MidWestUS or Outer Mongolia.

This also applies to flags, etc.&#xA;&#xA;⁴ Includes close flags (but *not* close or reopen votes).&#xA;&#xA;⁵ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.&#xA;&#xA;⁶ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).   &#xA;   &#xA;&#xA;Wishing you all a happy new year...&#xA;" />

If someone has a question more generally about distillation, particularly in a commercial setting, I think leaving that to https://alcohol.stackexchange.com/ seems reasonable.  But if someone has a question about distilling their fermented products themselves (i.e. at home) I think it could be reasonable to ask here, as long as they aren't specifically asking about how to break laws.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;See my argument [here](https://homebrew.meta.stackexchange.com/a/454/12609) for why I personally think merging the two SE sites could also make sense.  But I think the same argument applies to Homebrewing just being a little more permissive instead of eschewing questions that, while about the creation (and/or modification) of alcoholic drinks at home, but aren't *technically* about homebrewing.  It seems like they're similar goals and would presumably appeal to many of the same users." />
